Specifically, I'm passionate about applying distributed computing to make machine
learning even better. Projects like Anyscale's Ray and Apache Spark really tickle my brain.
\n &nbsp;

Currently, I'm looking for opportunities in software infrastructure work while expanding my technical skillset.
My most recent endeavor has been building a simplified clone of the Ray Core library, and I'm now
tackling the problem of creating a cloud file system, similar to Google Drive.
\n &nbsp;

Outside work, I enjoy crafting new recipes for my future caf√©, losing every game of
Monopoly and Night of the Ninja, unleashing my inner Zach Lavine in pickup basketball,
and petting my two cats, Cannon and Miso.
