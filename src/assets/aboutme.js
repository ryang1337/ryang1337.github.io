Specifically, I'm passionate about applying distributed computing to make machine
learning even better. Projects like Anyscale's Ray and Apache Spark really tickle my brain.
\n &nbsp;

Currently, I'm a founding engineer at **[Poly](https://www.withpoly.com)**, where I am building
out our **ML Infrastructure**. We are pioneering the future of design and giving designers the tools
to be even better at what they do.
\n &nbsp;

Outside work, I enjoy crafting new recipes for my future caf√©, losing every game of
Monopoly and Night of the Ninja, unleashing my inner Zach Lavine in pickup basketball,
and petting my two cats, Cannon and Miso.
